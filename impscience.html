    <h1>Class 10 Important Questions with Answers Science </h1>

    <button class="accordion">Diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen requirement of multicellular organisms like human. State reason.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Due to higher metabolic rate and the volume of human body is so large that oxygen cannot diffuse into all cells of the body quickly as oxygen will have to travel large distances to reach each and every cell. So diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen demand of multicellular organisms.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Write three types of blood vessels. Give one important feature of each.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The three types of blood vessels in human body are: (i) arteries, (ii) veins and (iii) capillaries.
            (i) Arteries are the blood vessels which carry blood from heart to various parts of the body. The walls of arteries are thick, elastic and muscular that enables them to dilate but not rupture when the heart contracts and forces blood into them.
            
            (ii) Veins are thin walled blood vessels which bring blood from the body back to the heart. They are larger and hold more blood than the arteries. The lumen of veins are provided with valves to prevent the backflow of blood.
            
            (iii) Capillaries are thin walled and extremely narrow blood vessels which occur at the terminals of artery and vein. The wall of capillaries are permeable to water and dissolved substances so that the exchange of materials between the blood and body cells can take place.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Describe in brief how urine is produced in human body. </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>In the kidney, the wastes are converted to urine by three processes :
            (i) Ultrafiltration : In it, large amount of water along with certain harmful substances like urea, uric acid, K+, ammonium salts, creatinine, etc., and certain useful substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., pass through glomerular capillaries and glomerular membrane into cavity of Bowman’s capsule of nephrons under pressure. The filtrate so formed is called nephric filtrate which is moved towards ureter.
            
            (ii) Selective reabsorption : In it, large amount of water and sodium, whole of glucose and amino acids and small amount of urea are passed back from nephric filtrate into blood capillaries. It occurs either by back diffusion (i.e., water and urea) or active transport (i.e., Na+, glucose and amino acids). It generally occurs in PCT (Proximal convoluted tubule) of nephrons.
            
            (iii) Tubular secretion : In this, certain harmful chemicals like uric acid, creatinine, K+, etc., are passed from blood capillaries surrounding the nephron into nephric filtrate by active transport. It generally occurs in DCT (Distal convoluted tubule) of nephrons. Now, the fluid is termed as urine and is excreted out of the excretory organs.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Define excretion.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The biological process involved in the removal of wastes, produced during various metabolic activities in the body from the body of an organism is called excretion. The wastes are non-gaseous nitrogenous wastes like ammonia, urea, uric acid, etc., along with excess of water, salts and pigments.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is the colour of ferrous sulphate crystals? How does this colour change after heating?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The colour of ferrous sulphate is pale green. The colour changes to reddish brown on heating due to formation of iron (III) oxide.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is meant by a chemical reaction?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The reaction representing a chemical change is called a chemical reaction.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Newly formed DNA copies may not be identical at times. Give one reason.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>When a cell reproduces, DNA replication occurs which results in formation of two similar copies of DNA. The process of copying the DNA leads to some variations each time. As a result, the DNA copies produced are similar to each other but sometimes may not identical.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Define reproduction. How does it helps in providing stability to the population of species?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The production of new organisms by the existing organisms of the same species is known as reproduction. It is linked to the stability of population of a species. DNA replication during reproduction ensures transfer of specific characters or body design features that is essential for an individual of a population to live and use that particular niche. Some variations present in a few individuals of population caused due to reproduction which also helps in their survival at changing niches</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does Plasmodium reproduce. Is this method sexual or asexual?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Plasmodium reproduces through multiple fission method. In this method, the parent organism splits to form many new organisms at the same time. This is an asexual method of reproduction.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What happens when a Planaria gets cut into two pieces?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>When Planaria is cut into two pieces then each piece grows into a complete organism. This is known as regeneration.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Why is small intestine in herbivores longer than in carnivores?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;">Digestion of cellulose takes a longer time. Hence, herbivores eating grass need a longer small intestine to allow complete digestion of cellulose. Carnivorous animals cannot digest cellulose, hence they have a shorter intestine.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is translocation? Why is it essential for plants?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;">The movement of food from leaves to other parts of the plant in phloem is called translocation. The translocation is necessary because every part of the plant needs food for obtaining energy, for building its parts and maintaining its life.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Give reasons for the following: Arteries have thick walls.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;">The heart pumps blood at high pressure. If arteries have thin walls they would burst because of high blood pressure. That is why arteries have thick walls.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Explain esterification reaction with the help of a chemical equation. Describe an activity to show esterification.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;">The reaction of carboxylic acid with alcohol forms an ester. This process of formation of ester is called esterification.
            CH3COOH + CH3CH2OH → CH3COOCH2CH3 + H2O
            
            Activity :
            (i) Take 1 ml of ethanol and 1 ml of glacial acid in a boiling tube and mix the contents well.
            (ii) Add few drops of conc.

            4
             to it.
            (iii) Warm the contents on a water bath for a few minutes.
            (iv) Now pour the solution in a beaker containing 20-50 ml of water.
            (v) A sweet fruity smell indicating formation of an ester is observed.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What are esters? How are they prepared? List two uses of esters.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;"> Esters are usually volatile liquids having pleasant smell (in fruity smell).
            Preparation: When carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a little concentrated sulphuric acid, it gives a pleasant smelling ester.
            
            For Example: When ethanoic acid is warmed with ethanol in the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid, a sweet smelling ester called ethyl ethanoate is formed.
            Uses:
            Esters are used in making perfumes.
            Esters are used in making artificial flavours and essences used in icecreams, sweets and cold drinks.</p>

    <button class="accordion"> What are isomers?
        Why can’t we have isomers of first three members of alkane series?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p style="color: crimson;">Isomers are compounds having the same molecular formula but different structures.
            Since branching is not possible, isomers are not possible for the first three members of alkanes series.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Differentiate between alkanes and alkenes. Name and draw the structure of one member of each</button>
    <div class="panel">
