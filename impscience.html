    <button class="accordion">Diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen requirement of multicellular organisms like human. State reason.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Due to higher metabolic rate and the volume of human body is so large that oxygen cannot diffuse into all cells of the body quickly as oxygen will have to travel large distances to reach each and every cell. So diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen demand of multicellular organisms.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Write three types of blood vessels. Give one important feature of each.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The three types of blood vessels in human body are: (i) arteries, (ii) veins and (iii) capillaries.
            (i) Arteries are the blood vessels which carry blood from heart to various parts of the body. The walls of arteries are thick, elastic and muscular that enables them to dilate but not rupture when the heart contracts and forces blood into them.
            
            (ii) Veins are thin walled blood vessels which bring blood from the body back to the heart. They are larger and hold more blood than the arteries. The lumen of veins are provided with valves to prevent the backflow of blood.
            
            (iii) Capillaries are thin walled and extremely narrow blood vessels which occur at the terminals of artery and vein. The wall of capillaries are permeable to water and dissolved substances so that the exchange of materials between the blood and body cells can take place.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Describe in brief how urine is produced in human body. </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>In the kidney, the wastes are converted to urine by three processes :
            (i) Ultrafiltration : In it, large amount of water along with certain harmful substances like urea, uric acid, K+, ammonium salts, creatinine, etc., and certain useful substances like glucose, amino acids, Na+, etc., pass through glomerular capillaries and glomerular membrane into cavity of Bowmanâ€™s capsule of nephrons under pressure. The filtrate so formed is called nephric filtrate which is moved towards ureter.
            
            (ii) Selective reabsorption : In it, large amount of water and sodium, whole of glucose and amino acids and small amount of urea are passed back from nephric filtrate into blood capillaries. It occurs either by back diffusion (i.e., water and urea) or active transport (i.e., Na+, glucose and amino acids). It generally occurs in PCT (Proximal convoluted tubule) of nephrons.
            
            (iii) Tubular secretion : In this, certain harmful chemicals like uric acid, creatinine, K+, etc., are passed from blood capillaries surrounding the nephron into nephric filtrate by active transport. It generally occurs in DCT (Distal convoluted tubule) of nephrons. Now, the fluid is termed as urine and is excreted out of the excretory organs.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Define excretion.</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The biological process involved in the removal of wastes, produced during various metabolic activities in the body from the body of an organism is called excretion. The wastes are non-gaseous nitrogenous wastes like ammonia, urea, uric acid, etc., along with excess of water, salts and pigments.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is the colour of ferrous sulphate crystals? How does this colour change after heating?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The colour of ferrous sulphate is pale green. The colour changes to reddish brown on heating due to formation of iron (III) oxide.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is meant by a chemical reaction?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The reaction representing a chemical change is called a chemical reaction.</p>
