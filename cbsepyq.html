    <h3>What made Hari Singh come back to Anil? 
    </h3>
    <h4>Hari Singh came back to Anil because Anil trusted him. He did not want to miss the chance of being educated. Education could certainly make him a better man. He was fed up with the life of a thief, i.e. stealing and being caught and beaten.</h5>

        <h3>Why does the poet not offer the boy money to buy another ball? </h3>
        <h4>The poet says “I will not intrude on him” because he wants the boy to learn the meaning of loss on his own. He does not offer him money to buy another ball because according to him, money or another ball is worthless. The boy was trying to understand his first responsibility as he had lost something, which could not be brought back.</h4>
