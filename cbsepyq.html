    <h1>Previous Year Question Papers Class 10</h1>

    <h3>What made Hari Singh come back to Anil? 
    </h3>
    <h4>Hari Singh came back to Anil because Anil trusted him. He did not want to miss the chance of being educated. Education could certainly make him a better man. He was fed up with the life of a thief, i.e. stealing and being caught and beaten.</h5>

        <h3>Why does the poet not offer the boy money to buy another ball? </h3>
        <h4>The poet says “I will not intrude on him” because he wants the boy to learn the meaning of loss on his own. He does not offer him money to buy another ball because according to him, money or another ball is worthless. The boy was trying to understand his first responsibility as he had lost something, which could not be brought back.</h4>



        <h3>QUE. “The new crops could make the difference between life and death”. Explain the above statement in context of Irish Potato Famine. </h3>
        <h4>Sometimes the new crops could make the difference between life and death.
            Europe’s poor began to eat better and live longer with the introduction of the humble potato.
            Ireland’s poorest peasants became so dependent on the potatoes that when disease destroyed the potato crop in the mid-1840s, hundreds of thousands died of starvation.
            Hungry children dug for potatoes in a field that had already been harvested, hoping to discover some leftovers.
            During the Great Irish Potato Famine around ten lakh people died of starvation in Ireland and double the number emigrated in search of work.</h4>

        <h3>QUE. ‘Trade flourished and markets expanded in the late 19th century, but there was a darker side to this process’. Substantiate.</h3>
        <h4>1. Trade flourished and market expanded in the late 19th century. But this was not only a period of expanding trade and increased property (wealth). There was a darker side to this process.
            2. In many parts of the world, the expansion of trade and a close relationship with the world economy also meant a loss of freedom and livelihoods.
            3. Late 19th century European conquests produced many painful economic, social and ecological changes through which colonised societies were brought into the world economy.
            4. In Africa in the 1890s a fast spreading disease of cattle plague or rinderpest had a terrifying impact on peoples livelihoods and local economy.
            5. The example of indentured labour migration from the colonies also shows the two-sided nature of the 19th century world. A world of economic growth as well as misery, higher incomes for some and poverty for others, technological advances along with new forms of coercion.</h4>
