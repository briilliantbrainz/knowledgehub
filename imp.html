                would come. According to Gandhiji it should begin with the surrender of titles that the
                British government awarded, and a boycott of civil services, army, police, courts and

                and 1960s ?</h3>
            <p>The minority French-speaking community was relatively rich and powerful. On the other hand Dutch-speaking
                community got the benefit of economic development and education much later. This was the cause of
                tension between two communities during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>

            <h3>Que. What were the effects of feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils ?</h3>
            <p>The effects of the feeling of alienation among the Sri Lankan Tamils were as mentioned below :

                1. The Sri Lankan Tamils launched parties and struggles for the recognition of Tamil as an official
                language.
                2. They demanded regional autonomy.
                3. They also demanded equality of opportunity in securing education and jobs.
                4. Their demand for regional autonomy was repeatedly denied.
                5. By 1980s several political organisations were formed and they demanded an s independent Tamil Eelam
                (state) in northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.
                6. The distrust and alienation turned into widespread conflict between the two communities. It soon
                turned into a civil war.
                7. In the civil war, thousands of people of both the communities were killed. Many
                families were forced to leave the country as refugees. Many lost their livelihoods. Thus although Sri
                Lanka had excellent record of economic development, education and health, but the civil war has caused a
                terrible setback to the social, cultural and economic life of the country.</p>

            <h3>Que. What is a recognised political party? </h3>
            <p>Ans. A recognised political party is a party, recognised by the ‘Election Commission’ with all the
                privileges and facilities.</p>


            <h3>Que. Given one point of difference between a pressure group and a political party.</h3>
            <p>Ans. A pressure group is an organized or unorganized body that seeks to promote its interests while a
                political party is a body that seeks to attain political power by contesting elections.</p>


            <h3>Que. Name any one political party that has national level political organisation but not recognised as a
                national political party. </h3>
            <p>Ans. State parties like the Samajwadi Party, Samata Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal have national level
                political organisations with units in several states but are not recognised as national parties.</p>

            <h3>Que. How do money and muscle power play an important role in elections?</h3>
            <p>Ans. Political parties need to face and overcome the growing challenge of Money and Muscle power during
                elections in order to remain effective instruments of democracy.

                Since parties are focussed only on winning elections, they tend to use shortcuts to win elections, for
                example, like booth-rigging, distribution of food, money, alcohol, etc. to the poor voters to get their
                votes. Political parties tend to nominate those candidates who have or can raise lots of money. Rich
                people and companies who give funds to the parties tend to have influence on the policies and decisions
                of the party. These days, parties are supporting criminals who can win elections. This is a major cause
                of concern to the democrats all over the world who are worried about the increasing role of rich people
                and big companies in democratic politics.</p>

                decide what kinds of goods and how much of each, should come into the country.</p>

            <h3>que. What are MNCs? How the MNCs functions? What are the main guiding factors of
                MNCs?</h3>
                <p>Ans. MNCs are Multinational corporations. It is a company that owns or controls production
                    in more than one Nation. MNCs set up offices and factories for production in region where
                    they can get cheap labour and other resources, closer to the markets. This is done to reduce
                    the cost of production and the MNCs can earn greater profits. MNCs not only sell its finished
                    products globally but also the goods and services are produced globally. The production
                    process is divided into small parts and spread across the globe.
                    The main guiding factors of MNCs are:
                    (i) Cheap production
                    (ii) Closeness of production unit to the markets.
                    (iii) Favourable government policies.</p>

                statement with examples in context of globalisation. </h3>
                <p>Ans. The Indian market has been transformed in recent years. The consumers have a wide
                    variety of goods and services to choose from, which were not available earlier. For
                    example:
                    The latest models of mobile phones, television, digital cameras of leading
                    manufacturers and other well known brands of the world are easily available in the
                    markets.
                    New models of cars and automobiles are launched every season.
                    The top companies in the world have introduced their popular brands in India for
                    various products like shirts, fruit juices, cosmetics, toys, furniture, stationery etc.
                    All this has been possible only due to globalisation. </p>

            <h3>Que. Why had the Indian government put barriers to foreign trade and foreign
                investment after independence? Analyze the reasons. </h3>
                <p>Ans. The Indian government put barriers on foreign trade and foreign investment after
                    independence because:
                    (a) It was considered necessary to protect the producers within the country from
                    foreign competition.
                    (b) In 1950s and 1960s, the industries were initial stage and competition from imports
                    at that stage would not have allowed these industries to develop.
                    (c) Therefore, India allowed the imports of only essential items like machinery,
                    fertilizers, petroleum etc. </p>
